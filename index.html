    <h1>Meet the college dropout who invented the gravitational wave detector </h1>

    <p> Nearly 50 years ago, Rainer Weiss dreamed up a way to
        detect 
        <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/topic/gravitational-waves"> 
            gravitational waves
        </a>—infinitesimal ripples in spacetime
        predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. Last
        September, that dream came true as 1000 physicists working with
        the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO),
        two huge detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford,
        Washington, sensed a pulse of waves radiated by two massive
        black holes as they spiraled into each other a billion light-years
        away. The discovery makes Weiss, a physicist at the
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, a sure
        bet to win a Nobel Prize, his peers say. Weiss, 83, acknowledges
        the prospect with some apprehension. “It will fuck me up for a
        year,” he predicts as he nimbly steers his silver Volkswagen Beetle
        ragtop through Cambridge traffic. “That’s what it did to John
        Mather.” The line is vintage “Rai,” his friends will tell you: blunt,
        irreverent, funny, and impatient with anything that gets in the way
        of his work.

        Weiss is also known for speaking his mind. “He is absolutely 100%
        committed to honesty both in his physics and in life,” says Peter
        Saulson, a LIGO physicist at Syracuse University in New York, who
        worked with Weiss at MIT in the 1980s. Dirk Muehlner, a retired
        physicist in Alamo, California, and one of Weiss’s early graduate
        students, shares that sentiment. “He’s totally honest. There’s no
        bullshitting for Rai. There’s no performance.”
