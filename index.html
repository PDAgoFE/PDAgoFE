    <p> Nearly 50 years ago, Rainer Weiss dreamed up a way to
        detect 
        <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/topic/gravitational-waves"> 
            gravitational waves
        </a>—infinitesimal ripples in spacetime
        predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. Last
        September, that dream came true as 1000 physicists working with
        the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO),
        two huge detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford,
        Washington, sensed a pulse of waves radiated by two massive
        black holes as they spiraled into each other a billion light-years
        away. The discovery makes Weiss, a physicist at the
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, a sure
        bet to win a Nobel Prize, his peers say. Weiss, 83, acknowledges
        the prospect with some apprehension. “It will fuck me up for a
        year,” he predicts as he nimbly steers his silver Volkswagen Beetle
        ragtop through Cambridge traffic. “That’s what it did to John
        Mather.” The line is vintage “Rai,” his friends will tell you: blunt,
        irreverent, funny, and impatient with anything that gets in the way
        of his work.

        Weiss is also known for speaking his mind. “He is absolutely 100%
        committed to honesty both in his physics and in life,” says Peter
        Saulson, a LIGO physicist at Syracuse University in New York, who
        worked with Weiss at MIT in the 1980s. Dirk Muehlner, a retired
        physicist in Alamo, California, and one of Weiss’s early graduate
        students, shares that sentiment. “He’s totally honest. There’s no
        bullshitting for Rai. There’s no performance.”

        As a teenager, Weiss developed two passions: classical music and
        electronics. Snapping up army surplus parts, he repaired radios out
        of his bedroom. He even made a deal with the local toughs: If they
        left him alone as he lugged radios to and from the subway, he’d fix
        theirs for free. “They would steal things and I would have to fix
        them,” he says. “It wasn’t a good deal.”

        Weiss’s sister, playwright Sybille Pearson, confirms that Weiss
        spent as much time as possible out of the unhappy home. But, as
        the only son, he was still something of a prince in his family, she
        says. For example, whenever the family moved to a new
        apartment, Weiss got the biggest bedroom to himself, she recalls.
        In the late 1960s that connection remained tenuous, however.
        Radiation from the big bang should have a “thermal spectrum” with
        a lopsided peak indicating the radiation’s temperature. At long
        wavelengths, several groups had observed a climbing spectrum
        consistent with a temperature of 3°C above absolute zero. But in
        1968, rocket measurements found high amounts of shorter
        wavelength radiation that clashed with a thermal spectrum and
        threatened the big bang hypothesis.

        To probe the matter, Weiss and his graduate student Muehlner built
        a device that would fly on a weather balloon and measure the
        microwave spectrum to shorter wavelengths. In 1973, after three
        flights and a rebuild, they had solid data that fit a thermal spectrum
        and for the first time revealed the telltale peak. “It completely
        destroyed the rocket result,” Burke says. “Among those interested
        in the microwave background, [Weiss] was suddenly one of their
        stars.”

        variations in the CMB’s temperature from point to point
        on the sky—traces of infinitesimal quantum fluctuations in the
        newborn universe that are essential to the standard model of
        cosmology. In 2006, Americans John Mather and George Smoot
        shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for, respectively, measuring the
        spectrum and detecting the fluctuations.

        Weiss realized that output could reveal a passing gravitational
        wave, which generally would stretch the arms by different amounts.
        He let the class chew on the idea in homework and wrote a 23-
        page report in the quarterly newsletter of MIT’s Research
        Laboratory of Electronics. LIGO sprouted from that document.
