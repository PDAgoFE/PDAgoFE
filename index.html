    <p>Nearly 50 years ago, Rainer Weiss dreamed up a way to
        detect gravitational waves—infinitesimal ripples in spacetime
        predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. Last
        September, that dream came true as 1000 physicists working with
        the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO),
        two huge detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford,
        Washington, sensed a pulse of waves radiated by two massive
        black holes as they spiraled into each other a billion light-years
        away. The discovery makes Weiss, a physicist at the
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, a sure
        bet to win a Nobel Prize, his peers say. Weiss, 83, acknowledges
        the prospect with some apprehension. “It will fuck me up for a
        year,” he predicts as he nimbly steers his silver Volkswagen Beetle
        ragtop through Cambridge traffic. “That’s what it did to John
        Mather.” The line is vintage “Rai,” his friends will tell you: blunt,
        irreverent, funny, and impatient with anything that gets in the way
        of his work.
